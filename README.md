# Introduction

The Fairlay Private API allows you to POST requests (creating/changing markets and orders, transfering funds, etc.), costs 0.1mBTC per 100.000 requests, see below on how to create your developer API account. This is the low level documentation, if you need a working sample or are more comfortable reading code rather than specifications, head over to https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient

All requests must be send via TCP in the following format

```signature|nonce|userid|requestID|requestData<ENDOFDATA>```

Every request must end with ```<ENDOFDATA>```

You must sign ```nonce|userid|requestID|requestData``` with your RSA key and provide your signature with all requests.

This is a sample GETBALANCE Request:

```
uiskPc9GqWAdUt1hJ+4VeuxyCNtbs0iY3kSbGQZ7HvwHkCe5H2n9UcX5v1Gl7Mb99XnhBiVzkne5bdkgmLdnlzzEBPLYnt8zwWHcqxXvIYiDpLQhsVfdkvyYwH1zgrUwAZu08VmY0ax34zxjXJdK68TVs9Y1m7akXkw5/NvIwXk=|635972931146604657|100012|22|<ENDOFDATA>
``` 

All answers are returned in the following format
```
signature|nonce|serverID|Response 
``` 
The response is usually JSON-encoded:

``` rfV2ylPLbDbBKEy0yi71xZS/fZbyozd7+smpit1cR8ZeB0qo+stRDttTkCxqF0towkS0bf3lkg4amSbvka6K//QX/F1BHdFNqpkFXQHB9jh2eyR2WgXblKeGRbgw+mma+1P/kKNBtf3qhOUiqOgzONwlTEusiLzqHil6HLTQTKY=|635972681796848020|66|{"PrivReservedFunds":334.049,"MaxFunds":0.0,"PrivUsedFunds":207.12,"AvailableFunds":126.946}``` 

If there is an error, the server returns an error message starting with **XError:** for general errors or **YError:** if there was an error in a subtask of a bulk change order request. 

```

Please note the following rules regarding the order matching:

When two open orders are matched, a Matched Order is created in the PENDING state.
If the maker of the bet cancels his bet within a certain time period the bet goes into the state MAKERVOIDED and is void. The said time period is defined in each unmatched order and matched order as "makerCancelTime" or "makerCT". The maximum allowed time is also provided as VisDelay for each runner (which is usually 0, 3000 or 6000 milliseconds).
Every time the maker of a bet exerts his right to (maker)void a bet, a fee is deducted from his account. This fee is currently 300 requests or 0.003mBTC but will be increased if needed.
When a market is settled the orders go to one of the settled states VOID, WON, HALFWON, LOST or HALFLOST.
Decimal market go into the state DECIMALRESULT while the settlement value DecResult will be set.
Regarding Binary Markets, please note that if you place a lay (bid , 0) bet with stake 100 and odds 2.50 your liability will be 150mBTC. This is different to the Fairlay website, where the stake is always the liablity.

```
### Remember to use (YOUR API ID*1000)+Request ID  on requests. Example: If you create your API accont on Fairlay, site will set an ID to it, usually first API ID is 1. So a request to Get Orderbook with this account will be 1001.

Returns:  User info object


Note: Use  https://superdry.apphb.com/tools/online-rsa-key-converter  to convert PEM RSA keys to XML format.

## <a name="21">GET ME</a> (21) 

```
signature|nonce|userid|21
```
Returns:  User info object containing last connections, withdraw adresses, market makers, funds, API Accounts, screen name and ID.

## <a name="22">GET MY BALANCE</a> (22) 

```
signature|nonce|userid|22
```
Returns:  JSON object containing account balance information:

**PrivReservedFunds**: Total account funds in mBTC.

```
signature|nonce|userid|49|
```

## <a name="44">SET FORCE NONCE TO FALSE</a> (44)

```

```

example for lmsrmarketmakerobject:

```
{"UserID":777888,
"Runner":5,
"Enabled":true,
"InitShareLimit":350.0,
"B":1300.0,
"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", 
"ShareStop":1400.0,
"InitProb":[0.3,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2],
"DiminishBack":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02],
"DiminishLay":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01],
"coolOffSeconds":36000.0,"coolOffFactor":4.0}
```
https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient/blob/master/src/Private/Datatypes/LMSR.cs

Default values:
```
{"UserID":[userid],
"Runner":5,
"Enabled":true,
"InitShareLimit":300.0,
"B":1000.0,
"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", 
"ShareStop":9999.0,
"InitProb":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],
"DiminishBack":[0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0,0.00],
"DiminishLay":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01],
"coolOffSeconds":1.0,"coolOffFactor":2.0}
```

**UserID**: must match your userid
**MarketID**:  must be provided
**Runner**:  # of Runners / must match the # of runners of the market
**Enabled**: must be set to true
**InitShareLimit** (must be > 1):    Shares that are offered in one order.  Stake + Winnings from one order are 350mBTC
**B** (must be > 10):    ~ is about the same as the maxium possible loss of the market maker
**CancelAll** (must be set to a future date):   Date where the market maker stops. Set to year 2100 if the mm should run forever
**ShareStop** (must be > 1):   amount of exposure in shares before the market maker stops.  Should be set higher than  B in regular cases.
**InitProb**:   the initial probability estimation for all runners
**DiminishBack** (must be non-negative):   In general the LMSR market maker runs on 0% margin, i.e. it doesn't make any profit.  If more margin should be added, you can worsen the odds for each bid orders for every runner.  0.01 worsens bid odds from  80% to 81%  (or 1.25 to 1.2345)  for example. 
**DiminishLay**:   same for all ask orders. 

*Cool off adds temporary additional margin to markets with increased activity and should be applied to markets that can have exogenous shocks or where real probabilities can deviate from the initial probability distribution. *

**coolOffFactor** (must be >=1):    if set to 4.0 the odds will worsen 4.0 times more than expected from the usual lmsr market maker.    
**coolOffSeconds** (must be >=1):    The time after which the coolOff period will be over. If set to 36000 the additional market margin will reduce step by step over an period of 10 hours. 

If no cool off is required, set coolOffSeconds to 1.

**Disable a MM by setting Enabled = false and other variables to a valid value. **

## <a name="70">GET MARKET MAKER</a> (70)

gets the current LMSR MM from the user for a given market.
