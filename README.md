# Fairlay Private API Documentation v0

All requests must be send via TCP in the following format

    signature|nonce|userid|requestID|requestData

every request must end with "<"ENDOFDATA">"

You must sign "nonce|userid|requestID|requestData" with your RSA key and provide your signature with all requests.

This is a sample GETBALANCE Request:

All answers are returned in the following format

 >   signature|nonce|serverID|Response 

The response is usually JSON-encoded:

> rfV2ylPLbDbBKEy0yi71xZS/fZbyozd7+smpit1cR8ZeB0qo+stRDttTkCxqF0towkS0bf3lkg4amSbvka6K//QX/F1BHdFNqpkFXQHB9jh2eyR2WgXblKeGRbgw+mma+1P/kKNBtf3qhOUiqOgzONwlTEusiLzqHil6HLTQTKY=|635972681796848020|66|{"PrivReservedFunds":334.0493827437273000001,"MaxFunds":0.0,"PrivUsedFunds":207.1029999999836,"AvailableFunds":126.9463827437437000001}

If there is an error, the server returns an error message starting with "XError: " for general errors or "YError: " if there was an error in a subtask of a bulk change order reqeust. 


## USE Another API Account

By default you use the native API Account 0.  If you want to use a different API Account, you have to add 1000 * API Account ID  to the request ID. 

Example:

If you like to get your balance using API Account #1 you call:

signature|nonce|userid|1022|

Note that you need to register API Account #1 via the fairlay website before you can use it. Normal users do not have the private key to use their native API Account #0.


## GETPUBLICKEY

## CANCELALLORDERS

## SETLMSRMARKETMAKER 

creates an automated LMSR market maker on a specific market

reqID: 73

reqData: json encoded LMSR Object

response: json encoded LMSR Object

example: 

{"UserID":777888,"MarketID":61659266392,"Runner":5,"Enabled":true,"InitShareLimit":350.0,"B":1300.0,"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", "ShareStop":1400.0,"InitProb":[0.3,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2],"DiminishBack":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02],"DiminishLay":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01],"coolOffSeconds":36000.0,"coolOffFactor":4.0}

Default values
{"UserID":[userid],"MarketID":61659266392,"Runner":5,"Enabled":true,"InitShareLimit":300.0,"B":1000.0,"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", "ShareStop":9999.0,"InitProb":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],"DiminishBack":[0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0,0.00],"DiminishLay":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01],"coolOffSeconds":1.0,"coolOffFactor":2.0}

UserID: must match your userid
MarketID:  must be provided
Runner:  # of Runners / must match the # of runners of the market
Enabled: must be set to true
InitShareLimit (must be > 1):    Shares that are offered in one order.  Stake + Winnings from each order are 350mBTC
B (must be > 10):    ~ is proportional to the maxium possible loss of the market maker if it starts at 50/50
CancelAll (must be set to a future date):   Date where the market maker stops. Set to year 2100 if the mm should run forever
ShareStop (must be > 1):   amount of exposure in shares before the market maker stops.  Should be set higher than  B in regular cases.
InitProb:   the initial probability estimation for all runners
DiminishBack (must be non-negative):   In general the LMSR market maker runs on 0% margin, i.e. it doesn't make any profit.  If more margin should be added, you can worsen the odds for each bid orders for every runner.  0.01 worsens bid odds from  80% to 81%  (or 1.25 to 1.2345)  for example. 
DiminishLay:   same for all ask orders. 

cool off adds temporary additional margin to markets with increased activity and should be applied to markets that can have exogenous shocks or where real probabilities can deviate from the initial probability distribution. 

coolOffFactor (must be >=1):    if set to 4.0 the odds will worsen 4.0 times more than expected from the usual lmsr market maker.    
coolOffSeconds (must be >=1):    The time after which the coolOff period will be over. If set to 36000 the additional market margin will reduce step by step over an period of 10 hours. 

If no cool off is required, set coolOffSeconds to 1.


Disable a MM by setting Enabled = false and other variables to a valid value.

This is a free service to scrape all markets on Fairlay. For all POST requests (creating/changing markets and orders) use the paid API.
* The data is updated every 5 seconds;
* You have to accept GZIP, DEFLATE in your HEADER;
* Use the __*SoftChangedAfter*__ parameter for incremental calls. Retrieve the server time and only query markets that have changed after your last request;
* 12 incremental calls are allowed per minute (the __*SoftChangedAfter*__ parameter must be set to not more than 30 seconds in the past);
* 1 call without a proper __*SoftChangedAfter*__ parameter is allowed per IP per minute;
* When using the markets request make sure that your URI is not too long;
* All times are UTC;
* Strings are not case sensitive.

For more examples how this API should be used together with our paid API, please take a look at our sample clients in [C#](https://github.com/Fairlay/CSharpSampleClient/blob/master/GetAPI.cs) and [Python](https://github.com/Fairlay/PythonSampleClient/blob/master/client.py#L291).
