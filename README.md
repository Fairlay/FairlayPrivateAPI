The Fairlay Private API allows you to POST requests (creating/changing markets and orders, transfering funds, etc.), costs 0.1mBTC per 100.000 requests, [see below](https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient#private-api) on how to create your developer API account. This is the low level documentation, if you need a working sample or are more comfortable reading code rather than specifications, head over to [https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient](https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient)

All requests must be send via TCP in the following format

> signature|nonce|userid|requestID|requestData

every request must end with "<"ENDOFDATA">"

You must sign "nonce|userid|requestID|requestData" with your RSA key and provide your signature with all requests.

This is a sample GETBALANCE Request:

> uiskPc9GqWAdUt1hJ+4VeuxyCNtbs0iY3kSbGQZ7HvwHkCe5H2n9UcX5v1Gl7Mb99XnhBiVzkne5bdkgmLdnlzzEBPLYnt8zwWHcqxXvIYiDpLQhsVfdkvyYwH1zgrUwAZu08VmY0ax34zxjXJdK68TVs9Y1m7akXkw5/NvIwXk=|635972931146604657|100012|22|<ENDOFDATA> 

All answers are returned in the following format

> signature|nonce|serverID|Response 

The response is usually JSON-encoded:

>  rfV2ylPLbDbBKEy0yi71xZS/fZbyozd7+smpit1cR8ZeB0qo+stRDttTkCxqF0towkS0bf3lkg4amSbvka6K//QX/F1BHdFNqpkFXQHB9jh2eyR2WgXblKeGRbgw+mma+1P/kKNBtf3qhOUiqOgzONwlTEusiLzqHil6HLTQTKY=|635972681796848020|66|{"PrivReservedFunds":334.0493827437273000001,"MaxFunds":0.0,"PrivUsedFunds":207.1029999999836,"AvailableFunds":126.9463827437437000001}

If there is an error, the server returns an error message starting with "XError: " for general errors or "YError: " if there was an error in a subtask of a bulk change order reqeust. 


# API Calls

## GETPUBLICKEY

> wvcdZiLhZj2bo9r77sCL7YvvQ0x9ziUq2QsQJ3e1zpdWVW31wIE5jQwmBmPtNeRtLyErwUB10m9L3ZzQuUJLLpC9vZN1VjOH1LZnFw3JlcV5xTI+qUTiDRlq4wQ+9LCKPeY9u9DPKoJRSGSYP+ZSpBNk5xQ7Af/ehplWPKT6X4A=|635978817532384436|777888|GETPUBLICKEY

Response:  returns the server's public key in XML format.


## GETSERVERTIME 2

> signature|nonce|userid|2

Response: returns the server's time in ticks.

Note: the server time can also be interfered from the nonce in every response.


## CREATE ACCOUNT 20 

> signature|nonce|userid|20|<RSAKeyValue><Modulus>1g1p6dleaZfBac+aKDVfDwnh2AN9l/GW9qYuDDVRg8v9muUs7qoIcYqaZbuZq792MB1kqmWvyQui4a9HLodFbAwowBQ+IVceNYnEUFVyVrIgfzUWVvJ5kgxTDCNV3Z0xSq8GuqD1wpdSAWi4vPvmWg3KCjbbr30MzWaniNLauRU=</Modulus><Exponent>AQAB</Exponent></RSAKeyValue>|999999
creation and all future requests.  

Returns:  User info object

Note: Use  https://superdry.apphb.com/tools/online-rsa-key-converter  to convert PEM RSA keys to XML format.


## CREATE API ACCOUNT 23

Example:  to create an API account call:

> signature|nonce|userid|23|API Account ID|<RSAKeyValue><Modulus>1g1p6dleaZfBac+aKDVfDwnh2AN9l/GW9qYuDDVRg8v9muUs7qoIcYqaZbuZq792MB1kqmWvyQui4a9HLodFbAwowBQ+IVceNYnEUFVyVrIgfzUWVvJ5kgxTDCNV3Z0xSq8GuqD1wpdSAWi4vPvmWg3KCjbbr30MzWaniNLauRU=</Modulus><Exponent>AQAB</Exponent></RSAKeyValue>

API Account ID:   can be any integer from 1 to 9. You can have up to 9 seperate API Accounts. Each API Account has it's own nonce, public key and it's own privileges.

returns "New APIUser Added"


## USE DIFFERENT API ACCOUNT (+1000)

By default you use API Account  0.  If you want to use a different API Account you have to add 1000 * API Account ID  to the request ID.

Example:
If you like to get your balance using API Account #5 you call:

> signature|nonce|userid|5022|

Note that you need to register API Account #5 before you can use it.


## SET API ACCOUNT TO READONLY 49

> signature|nonce|userid|5049|

this will permanently set your API Account #5 to Read Only. This cannot be undone.

You can also set your API Account #0 to read only. But be careful with it:

> signature|nonce|userid|49|

## SETMM 73

this sets up an fully automated LMSR market maker.  Google the term to get familiar with the usage. 

> signature|nonce|userid|73|lmsrmarketmakerobject

example for lmsrmarketmakerobject:
{"UserID":777888,"MarketID":61659266392,"Runner":5,"Enabled":true,"InitShareLimit":350.0,"B":1300.0,"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", "ShareStop":1400.0,"InitProb":[0.3,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2],"DiminishBack":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02],"DiminishLay":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01],"coolOffSeconds":36000.0,"coolOffFactor":4.0}

Default values
{"UserID":[userid],"MarketID":61659266392,"Runner":5,"Enabled":true,"InitShareLimit":300.0,"B":1000.0,"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", "ShareStop":9999.0,"InitProb":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],"DiminishBack":[0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0,0.00],"DiminishLay":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01],"coolOffSeconds":1.0,"coolOffFactor":2.0}

UserID: must match your userid
MarketID:  must be provided
Runner:  # of Runners / must match the # of runners of the market
Enabled: must be set to true
InitShareLimit (must be > 1):    Shares that are offered in one order.  Stake + Winnings from one order are 350mBTC
B (must be > 10):    ~ is about the same as the maxium possible loss of the market maker
CancelAll (must be set to a future date):   Date where the market maker stops. Set to year 2100 if the mm should run forever
ShareStop (must be > 1):   amount of exposure in shares before the market maker stops.  Should be set higher than  B in regular cases.
InitProb:   the initial probability estimation for all runners
DiminishBack (must be non-negative):   In general the LMSR market maker runs on 0% margin, i.e. it doesn't make any profit.  If more margin should be added, you can worsen the odds for each bid orders for every runner.  0.01 worsens bid odds from  80% to 81%  (or 1.25 to 1.2345)  for example. 
DiminishLay:   same for all ask orders. 

cool off adds temporary additional margin to markets with increased activity and should be applied to markets that can have exogenous shocks or where real probabilities can deviate from the initial probability distribution. 

coolOffFactor (must be >=1):    if set to 4.0 the odds will worsen 4.0 times more than expected from the usual lmsr market maker.    
coolOffSeconds (must be >=1):    The time after which the coolOff period will be over. If set to 36000 the additional market margin will reduce step by step over an period of 10 hours. 

If no cool off is required, set coolOffSeconds to 1.

Disable a MM by setting Enabled = false and other variables to a valid value. 

## GETMM 70
